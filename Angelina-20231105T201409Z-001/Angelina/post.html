                The standards of beauty have been set extremely high in society, which have led women to feel insecure. I agree that women wear make up to enhance their self-esteem because the goals of cosmetics are to cover imperfections such as pimples red ness, and pores. Many women don’t want to walk around showing imperfections on their faces, but having cosmetics that can cover those insecurity’s can bring alive a women’s confidence and define their beauty. Gabourey Sidibe, an American actress who played the main role in Precious, mentioned, “One day I decided that I was beautiful, and so I carried out my life as if I was a beautiful girl. I wear colors that I really like, I wear makeup that makes me feel pretty, and it really helps.

                It doesn't have anything to do with how the world perceives you. What matters is what you see.”  Sidibe exemplifies the true beauty within herself. She explains how the perception of society does not matter in the eyes of the individual. What does matter is how she views herself as “a beautiful girl.”  I agree with Gabourey Sidibe, because if a woman feels insecure it really shouldn’t matter if they’re wearing make up or not because getting mad at someone for wearing make up is like getting mad at someone eating a hot dog when your in a diet. A woman is just tying to feel comfortable in her skin and it shouldn’t be anyone’s business but hers.
